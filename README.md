# VibeConnect

VibeConnect is a real-time chat application designed to facilitate seamless communication between users. Built with a modern tech stack, the project utilizes React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. Authentication and authorization are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access to the application's features. Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional communication, allowing users to exchange messages instantly and see each other's online status in real time. MongoDB serves as the database, managed through Mongoose for efficient data storage and retrieval. The application boasts features such as user profile management, error handling, and notification sounds to enhance the user experience. With proper deployment to platforms like Heroku or AWS, VibeConnect delivers a scalable, secure, and performant chat solution for users to connect and interact seamlessly.
